Yet Another SCheMe interpreter, this time in Haskell!  
PS: This project is a rewritten version of [rusk] interpreter, originally written in Rust.

## Todo

- Load source file
- stdlib written in Scheme

## Notes

This project uses `hpack`. To build it using `stack build`, run `hpack` to generate the `.cabal` file.
